![Netflix Logo](https://github.com/nandini-832/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/IMG_2187.PNG)

# Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

# Objectives
Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.
# Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset: [
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Findings and Conclusions
Our analysis of Netflix’s content reveals several key insights. Content production trends fluctuate over time, with notable growth in certain genres in recent years. TV shows tend to have larger casts and vary in the number of seasons depending on the country.

Directors vary widely — some collaborate with many actors, while others have only one title on the platform. Content maturity ratings show Netflix balances family-friendly, teen, and adult programming, adjusting over time to audience preferences.

Seasonal spikes in new releases suggest strategic timing, and regional differences highlight that some countries focus more on TV shows or documentaries. Actors with diverse genre experience contribute to content variety, and title lengths vary significantly, reflecting different creative approaches.

Overall, these findings paint a picture of a dynamic, evolving content library shaped by audience demand, regional trends, and strategic decisions — offering valuable guidance for future content development and marketing strategies.
